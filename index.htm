    <!-- NARUTO'S BIO -->
    <div class="Div">
        <p><img height="190" src="imgs/NarutoDP.jpg" ALIGN="left">&emsp;<b>Naruto Uzumaki</b> (うずまきナルト, <i>Uzumaki Naruto</i>) is a shinobi of 
            Konohagakure. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his 
            birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his 
            &nbsp;childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's 
            acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the 
            following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable 
            ninja &nbsp;regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the 
            world, becoming known as the <b>Hero of the Hidden Leaf</b> (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, 
            Konohagakure no Eiyū, Literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). 
            He soon &nbsp;proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi
            World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's 
            <b>Seventh Hokage</b> (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, lit. Seventh Fire 
            Shadow). <a href="https://boruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki" target="_blank"> <br>&nbsp;More about Uzumaki Naruto.</a>
